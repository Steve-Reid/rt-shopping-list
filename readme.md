# Notes App

This is a notes application built on Meteor and React.



## Getting Started

This app requires you to have Meteor installed on your machine. Then you can clone the repo and run the following:

```
meteor npm install
```

```
meteor
```

The app can then be view in the browser at localhost port 3000.

## Running the Tests

Testing is carried out using [Enzyme](https://github.com/airbnb/enzyme) and [mjackson expect assertions](https://github.com/mjackson/expect).

It's easy to run the tests. All you have to do is run the following command and view the reporter at localhost port 3000.

```
npm test
```
